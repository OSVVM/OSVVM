# The OSVVM Utility Library 
The [OSVVM utility library](https://github.com/OSVVM/OSVVM) offers
the same capabilities as those provided by other verification
languages (such as SystemVerilog and UVM):

 - Transaction-Level Modeling and verification components
 - Constrained Random test generation
 - Functional Coverage with hooks for UCIS coverage database integration
 - Intelligent Coverage Random test generation
 - Utilities for testbench process synchronization generation
 - Utilities for clock and reset generation
 - Transcript files
 - Error logging and reporting - Alerts and Affirmations
 - Message filtering - Logs
 - Scoreboards and FIFOs (data structures for verification)
 - Memory models
 
 [Documentation for the Utility library can be found here](https://github.com/OSVVM/Documentation)
 
## Release History
   For current release information see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
   
## Downloading the libraries
The library [OSVVM-Libraries](https://github.com/OSVVM/OsvvmLibraries) 
contains all of the OSVVM libraries as submodules.
